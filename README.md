# aoc-go
My Advent of Code solutions using Golang

## How to use
Just build and give it a try. The usage is quite simple, I'm pretty sure you can handle it! 

```
aoc stands for Advent of Code, an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles. 
This CLI was built to organize my Golang solves and to help running each of them.

For example, 'aoc 2020 day07 input.txt' will solve 
the 7th day problem of the year 2020.

Usage:
  aoc [command]

Available Commands:
  2020        Executes 2020 solves
  help        Help about any command

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for aoc

Use "aoc [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```
